## **🌐 Personal Portfolio Website (WIP)**

This repository will host the source code for my personal portfolio website, currently under development. The goal is to create a clean, responsive, and interactive site to showcase my engineering projects, design work, and technical skills.

### **🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned):**
- HTML – For content structure
- CSS – For responsive design and layout
- JavaScript – For interactivity and dynamic features
- (+ anything else I find useful along the way)

### 🚧 What to Expect:
- Project galleries with writeups, images, and CAD previews
- Blog or update section for ongoing builds and experiments
- Fully mobile-friendly design
- Hosted via GitHub Pages once complete
